# 🔥 Forest Fire in Brazil - Data Analysis Project

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on forest fires in Brazil using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. It aims to uncover trends, patterns, and key insights about forest fires across Brazilian states over the years.

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used contains records of forest fires in Brazil, including:
- `year`: The year of the fire
- `month`: Month of occurrence
- `state`: Brazilian state
- `number`: Number of fires recorded
- `date`: Optional full date field (if available)

You can find similar datasets on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) or government portals like [INPE](http://www.inpe.br/).

## 🧪 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**  
   Load the dataset using Pandas and inspect the structure.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Standardize column names  
   - Map month names to numbers  
   - Handle missing or incorrect data

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   - Fires per year  
   - Fires by state  
   - Seasonal trends  
   - Heatmap of monthly fire counts by year

4. **Visualizations**  
   Bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps are used to illustrate key trends.

## 📌 Key Insights

- Some years have shown significant spikes in fire counts.
- Fires peak during the dry season, especially around **August to October**.
- Certain states like **Pará**, **Mato Grosso**, and **Amazonas** are heavily impacted.
